# KernelDriverkSockets
A simple kernel driver for R/W Using kSockets with some bypass implementation. It's not the best for a Kernel Cheat but offers the minimal basics of Bypasses (PiDDB, HashBucket, MMU/MML) Along with skCrypt Implementation.

Don't expect this to be undetected unless you use a cert.
